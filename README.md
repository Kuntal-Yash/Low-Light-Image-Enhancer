# Low-Light-Image-Enhancer
This project enhances low-light image quality and object detection using YOLO and Zero-DCE. It optimizes light-enhancement with DCE-Net for RGB channels, customizes loss functions, and integrates attention mechanisms. 

## MODEL:

The Zero-DCE Framework:
The DCE-Net aims to derive optimal light-enhancement curves (LE-curves) for a given input image.
These curves are applied iteratively to transform all pixels within the input's RGB channels, resulting in the final enhanced image.
Understanding Light-Enhancement Curves:
Light-enhancement curves automatically enhance low-light images, with parameters adapting based on the input image.
Three primary considerations:
Preservation of Pixel Value Range: Ensures pixel values fall within [0,1] to prevent information loss.
Monotonicity: Maintains contrast between adjacent pixels.
Curve Simplicity and Differentiability: Shapes kept simple while remaining differentiable for training.
Application of Light-Enhancement Curves:
Curves are applied independently to each RGB channel, not solely to the illumination channel.
This approach preserves original colors and reduces the risk of over-saturation.


## DCE-Net Overview:
The DCE-Net is a lightweight deep neural network designed to learn the mapping between a low-light input image and its corresponding curve parameter maps.
It operates by taking a low-light image as input and generating a set of pixel-wise curve parameter maps for higher-order curves as output.
Architecture Details:
Input: Low-light image.
Output: Set of pixel-wise curve parameter maps.
Structure: Plain CNN with seven convolutional layers featuring symmetrical concatenation.
Convolutional Layers:
Each layer comprises 32 convolutional kernels of size 3Ã—3 and a stride of 1.
ReLU activation function is applied after each convolutional operation to introduce non-linearity.
Final Layer and Activation:
The last convolutional layer is followed by the Tanh activation function.
This layer produces 24 parameter maps for 8 iterations, with each iteration requiring three curve parameter maps for the three RGB channels.
